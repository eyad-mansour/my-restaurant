        The opening of Scott’s Richmond in September 2022 marks the beginning of
        a new chapter. Scott’s of Mount Street, Mayfair, has defined London
        dining through countless changing decades and has a sparkling, storied
        past that is the stuff of local legend. Now it is expanding into a new
        location for the first time, the scene is set for a decadent new
        narrative. Sited on a westward meander of the Thames, some 15 winding
        river miles upstream of central London, Richmond has a history and magic
        all its own. Weeping willows caress the water with supple branches and
        herds of deer range freely amid the splendour of the royal park, just as
        they did when Elizabeth, I surveyed them from the grounds of Richmond
        Palace. Roaring into the town in a burst of champagne fizz, Scott’s will
        shake up its new riverside setting with a cocktail of old-world elegance
        and glamorous destination dining.
